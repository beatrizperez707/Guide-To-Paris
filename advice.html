    <h1> Mistakes You Won't Wanna Make During Your Trip </h1>
    <h2> Tip Number One</h2>
      <img src="greeting.jpeg" alt="greeting">
    <p> As Americans, we are not accustomed to greeting upon entry at a store. It is important you remember to say "Bonjour" (if it is daytime) and "Bonsoir" (if it is night time) You will recieve harsh stares if you walk up to someone in Paris before greeting them first. </p>
  
      
      <h2> Tip Number Two</h2>
      <p>To avoid scams during your trip to Paris, do NOT accept any gifts from strangers. Once you have accepted their gift, they will demand payment upfront. If you're thinking, "Well what if I just return their gift or walk away?" You will be shocked to find out that they will not stop there. In fact they will go as far as to following you until you give up your money! </p>
    
    <h2> Tip Number Three</h2>

    <p>Depending on what your preference might be, traveling to Paris during it's high season, isnt recommended. Throughout June to August, it is most crowded and you will not be able to enjoy the views as much. It is better to travel during November to February.</p>
